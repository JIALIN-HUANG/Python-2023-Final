# Python-2023-Final
This is my final project for Data and Design Sp 2023

My project is a language-based generative experiment aimed at challenging the limitations of our basic understanding of words. Users input a word on the website, and the database randomly generates an unexpected and creative interpretation of the word. It is the left brain trying to produce a product that has been organized by culture, but the actual result allows the right brain's creative thinking to take effect. Users input one word and receive a randomly generated interpretation related to the word from a set of different database containing user generative content from different social media platform.
